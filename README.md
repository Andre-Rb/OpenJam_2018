# OpenJam_2018

This a repo for my participation in the [OpenJam2018](https://itch.io/jam/open-jam-2018) [GamePage](https://drenghel.itch.io/rejected-trolley-wanderers)

Disclaimer, game crashes, I used an Unstable Version of Godot, runs ok in the Editor, can't produce an export for now !

If it worked you'd be able to control a simple character, holding ads in his hand and spam passerby in order to give them, until your stash depletes and you make consumerism win !

Controls :
  R To Reload
  Arrows to move (or zqsd)
  Space to give ad
